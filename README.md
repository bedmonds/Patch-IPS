Patch::IPS
==========

Apply and create binary file patches in the IPS format.


## Synopsis

```perl6
use Patch::IPS qw<apply>;

Patch::IPS.apply(
  patch => '/home/able/baker/cooking.ips',
  target => '/home/kitchen/staff.nes',
  outfile => '/home/kitchen/delicious-cookies.nes'
);
```


## Description

IPS is a format that is still widely used by the ROM hacking community.

This provides a simple API to generate a patch by comparing two files, 
and to apply an existing patch to a file.
